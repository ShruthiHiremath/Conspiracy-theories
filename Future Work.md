Since I have collected most of the data and done some basic analysis, I would want to see how to use the data I have collected. Hence these are the few tasks that I think might be feasible and can be attempted in the next few weeks:<br/>
1. What were the terms/concepts/theories discussed and during what time frames on the subreddit? Example: If a conspiracy aroused, what was the time frame from its birth till its extinction? What aspect of the conspiracy was most discussed?<br/>
2. Were there any external factors that took place to give rise to such theories?<br/>
3. What were the discussions like? Can we predict these discussions given a situation where a new but similar conspiracy were to be faced?<br/>
4. Since I have collected the user timelines and have this data, the study can be geared towards the users as well â€“ how do they behave on other forums? Does the information they gather elsewhere affect the kind of discussions held on this subreddit? Does information percolate? <br/>
5. I have not worked much with NLP, but I guess there could be some methodologies that could be used to make deductions from text that I am not aware of.<br/>
