For obtaining the user timelines these are the steps I have followed:
Unique_Users is my table that contains the unique users across the comments and the submissions
1. SELECT * FROM [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2009] WHERE author in (select Users from comments_conspiracy.Unique_Users)
(Change the year from 2009 - 2016-08).
OR
1.SELECT * FROM [fh-bigquery:reddit_posts.full_corpus_201512] WHERE author in (select Users from comments_conspiracy.Unique_Users);
(For the full corpus data)
2. Run the query and save the result as a table --> Show Options -->Select Destination Table -->Check 'Allow Large Results' in the Result Size
--> Uncheck Flatten results in Results Schema --> Run Query
3. Once the table is created --> Export Table --> For the google cloud storage uri give the value -->  
reddit-data-conspiracy/?project=reddit-143620/filename-*.csv(it stores it in parts) --> Ok
4. Once the job is run go to the google cloud storage location and download the CSV files manually to your local machine
5. Upload these files to the server.

I have completed collecting all the user timelines:
flashmob00 has data from 2009-2011
flashmob01 has data from 2012-2016 and the full corpus
